wasta-vertex (0.9.1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * debian/postinst: removing all /usr/share/icons/Moka/*/apps/nemo.png icons.
    These icons aren't needed for nemo and cause a problem as they are used
    to override the nemo "eject drive" icon.  By removing them, the default
    eject icon is again used (I think due to inheritance from ubuntu-mono-dark)
