Description: Icon Theme based on vertex-icons
 Thanks to horst3180 for his great vertex-icons icon theme.  Original source
 found here: https://github.com/horst3180/Vertex-icons.  Wasta-Vertex uses
 the vertex-icons folder icons for larger sizes but modifies the 16/22/24 px
 folder icons.  All other icons are inherited by ubuntu-mono-dark.  The
 inherited theme can be changed in the index.theme file.
 For example, the default linked theme of vertex-icons is Moka.
